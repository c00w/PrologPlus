Prolog + by Colin Rice

This is an extended prolog language interpreter. It supports, ors, ands, and negations

Installation:
-----------------------
We need a working installation of python2.7. On linux you run sudo apt-get install python27. On windows it's a download on python.org. You want the 2.7.3 version (Although any 2.7 version will work)

Basic Usage:
---------------------
From the command line run:
python prolog_+ Interpreter.py
On windows double click the Interpreter.py file.

Allowed Statements:
----------------------
You can use almost all of the features of normal prolog.
EX:

A(a):.
>>>A(a)?
True
>>>dump
<Statement Predicate(A, Variable("A")):None >

A(a):.
B(X):A(X).
>>>B(a)?
True

You can also use negations.

A(a):.
B(X):A(X).
>>>!B(a)?
False

!A(a):.
B(X):!A(X).
>>>B(a)?
True

Other supported features are or statements.

A(a):.
B(X):A(X)|C(X).
>>>B(a)?
True

And and statements in the head.
A(a):.
B(X),C(x):A(X).
>>>B(a)?
True
>>>C(a)?
True

Syntax:
---------
Variables start with a capitol letter, atoms with a lower letter.
Predicate names start with a capitol letter.

Known Bugs:
------------
If you use or statements in the head they should be rewritten as follows:
A(X) | B(X) : C(X).
to:
A(X):C(X),!B(X)
B(X):C(X),!A(X)

They currently are not. They are just ignored.

The following statement works:
A(a):.
B(b):.
C(d):A(X),B(X).
>>>C(d)?
True
